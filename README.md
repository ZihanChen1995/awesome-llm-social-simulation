### Position Papers & Perspectives

- **[2025.07] Integrating LLM in Agent-Based Social Simulation: Opportunities and Challenges** `[survey]` `[critique]`  
  Taillandier et al. Submitted to *JASSS*. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19364)]  
  > Critical perspective from the classical ABM community. Key argument: LLMs may create *illusions* of behavioral fidelity through pattern matching without genuine understanding. Distinguishes contexts where LLMs add clear value (interactive simulations, serious games) from where they are problematic (explanatory/predictive modeling). Advocates hybrid LLM + rule-based approaches (GAMA, NetLogo).

- **[2025.06] LLM-based Social Simulations Require a Boundary** `[position]` `[critique]`  
  Wu, Peng, Ito, Xiao. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806)]  
  > Argues for principled scope limitations on what LLM simulations can claim to model.

- **[2025.04] LLM Social Simulations Are a Promising Research Method** `[position]`  
  Anthis et al. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02234)]  
  > Optimistic counterpart to the critique papers. Identifies five tractable challenges for the field. Introduces the key concept of **"alienness"** — LLMs superficially match human behavior but operate with non-humanlike mechanisms. Argues sims are already usable for pilot/exploratory research. Well-cited, ICML 2025.

- **[2025.04] Do Large Language Models Solve the Problems of Agent-Based Modeling? A Critical Review** `[critique]`  
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03274)]  
  > Systematic review of 35 generative ABM papers categorizing their validation practices. Finds most validation is either subjective (expert judgment, often the authors themselves) or circular (LLM-judges validating LLM behavior). Important reference for the Social Sim Eval project.

- **[2025.02] Simulate Anything: A Generalized Social Simulation Framework Driven by LLM Agents Based on a Large-scale Real-World User Pool** `[position]`  
  Wang et al. [[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YEhLMBNLNp)]

- **[2023.09] Generative Agent-Based Modeling: Unveiling Social System Dynamics through Coupling Mechanistic Models with Generative AI** `[position]`  
  Ghaffarzadegan et al. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11456)]

- **[2023] Large Language Models as Simulated Economic Agents: What Can We Learn from Homo Silicus?** `[position]`  
  Horton. NBER Working Paper.  
  > Foundational framing paper for using LLMs as economic simulation proxies. Coined the "homo silicus" concept.

### Validation-Focused Critical Work

- **[2026.01] Validation is the Central Challenge for Generative Social Simulation** `[critique]` `[survey]` `[🔥 new]`  
  *Artificial Intelligence Review* (Epub Nov 2025). [[Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-025-11412-6)] [[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41268053/)]  
  > Published in a major AI journal — will likely become the canonical validation critique. Central finding: LLMs may **exacerbate** rather than alleviate ABM's longstanding validation problems due to black-box structure, cultural biases, and stochastic outputs. Proposes three-part yardstick: (1) purpose alignment, (2) external grounding, (3) robustness. Essential reading for any eval-focused work.

- **[2025.12] Towards Operational Validation of LLM-Agent Social Simulations** `[application]` `[validated]` `[🔥 new]`  
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21740)] (updated Dec 31, 2025)  
  > One of very few papers that actually does rigorous validation. Simulates a Voat-like forum using the YSocial digital-twin platform with 30 independent replications and quantitative comparison to matched empirical data. Finds operational validity is achievable with calibration — but identifies architectural choices (stateless dialogue, simplified feedback rules) that cause divergence.
